# Order Management System 🧾🍽️

Here is my **Order Management System** a C# console application that I built as part of a school programming competition.

The project was built using **object-oriented programming** principles in C# and includes features such as:

✅ Adding, modifying, and deleting orders  
📊 Calculating total revenue  
🔍 Searching for orders  
🔐 Admin login with hashed passwords  
📁 Exporting order data to CSV  
🧹 Full data management (clear all, etc.)

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- C# (.NET)
- Visual Studio
- Console Application
- OOP Design
- File I/O (CSV export)
- SHA-256 for password hashing

## 🏁 Motivation

This project was submitted for a **school-level programming competition** focused on applying C# fundamentals in a real-world scenario.  
The goal was to simulate a basic restaurant order system with an admin interface and data persistence features.
